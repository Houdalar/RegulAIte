# 🤝 Contributing to RegulAIte

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to **RegulAIte** — a beginner-friendly, open-source Q&A assistant that answers questions about company policies based on uploaded documents.

This is my **first project** and I'm learning as I go. I'm exploring LLMs, RAG pipelines, and open-source AI — and I'd love for others to learn and grow with me.

**Everyone is welcome to contribute** — whether you're a developer, writer, designer, or just curious.
